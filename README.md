# React + Vite

Demo: https://abdullahshabaan.github.io/react-app/
Developed a comprehensive pet adoption application leveraging modern web development tools and methodologies. Utilized a combination of React.js and associated libraries to create a seamless user experience.

Technologies Utilized:

React.js: Employed React.js for building reusable UI components, managing state efficiently using hooks, and implementing dynamic routing for navigation.

Context API: Leveraged React's Context API to provide global state management, ensuring data accessibility across various components without prop drilling.

React Query: Implemented React Query for efficient data fetching, caching, and synchronization with server data, enhancing application performance and responsiveness.

Error Boundaries: Implemented error boundaries to gracefully handle and display errors, ensuring a smoother user experience and better error handling.

Portals: Utilized React Portals for rendering children components into a different DOM subtree, facilitating modal dialogs and overlays while maintaining a clean component hierarchy.

Lazy Loading and Suspense: Employed lazy loading and Suspense to optimize performance by deferring the loading of non-critical resources until they are needed, thereby improving initial load times and reducing time to interactivity.

Development Best Practices:

Component-based Architecture: Adhered to a component-based architecture for modularity and reusability, allowing for easier maintenance and scalability of the application.

State Management with Hooks: Utilized React hooks for managing component state, avoiding class-based components for cleaner and more concise code.

Efficient Data Fetching with Effects: Leveraged useEffect hook for performing side effects such as data fetching and updating the UI in a declarative and efficient manner.

Performance Optimization: Employed various techniques such as code splitting, memoization, and optimizing render performance to deliver a fast and responsive user experience.

Error Handling and Recovery: Implemented robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected errors and recover from failures, ensuring a more resilient application.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
